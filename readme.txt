2. Please download the input dataset and place in YOUR GOOGLE DRIVE. Then change the below path in the code so that the code picks up the file from YOUR drive.
(just change the paths, keep the file names as it is).
(do CTRL+F to file all instances and replace those)
Changes to be made:
#1
My path - /content/drive/MyDrive/INFO555/Project1/IMDB_Dataset.csv
Modify to - /your/drive/path/IMDB_Dataset.csv

#2
My path - /content/drive/MyDrive/INFO555/Project1/cleaned_reviews.csv
Modify to - /your/drive/path/cleaned_reviews.csv
Doing so will ensure 2 things - the file is taken from YOUR drive and also saved in YOUR drive.
